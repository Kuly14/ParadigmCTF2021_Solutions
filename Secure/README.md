# Secure Solution

This was the most hilarious challenge of the CTF. I spent about an hour and a half looking through the contracts to find the vulnerability.

I wrote 2 test contracts to see if there wasn't some difference in solidity 0.5.12

After all this I thought if it would be cheating to just send the weth into the contract. So I looked up the solution and it turns out you can xD.

I think this is the perfect definition of having to think outside the box.
